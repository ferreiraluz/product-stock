## a database connection with Sequelize;
## Simple products stocks app
## I hope to you like it!

## frameworks that I used:  

# Express for my routes;

# Sequelize for the connection to my database;

# A template engine that I used was handlebars;

# I used too Body-Parser for get the handlebars' forms.

# IS OPEN SOURCE.

## The database config was hidden for security measures. But the config file was in the file "src/database/config/db.js" and imported in "src/database/models.js" and models.js was exported to the app.js.
